BUSINESS RULE SPECIFICATIONS

RULE INFORMATION

Statement:  Reservation times must not overlap for the same resource. This is to say, if a material has checked out for some time, someone else should not be able to check out the material for the same time (for any overlap).

Constraint: Loan Start Date and Return Date for one record cannot have any overlap with another record. This includes record A encompassing record B entirely and vice versa, as well as A overlapping B's Start Date but not Return Date and vice versa, and same for Return Date but not Start Date and vice versa.

ACTION TAKEN

Implemented a series of TRIGGERs to check that materials do not have an overlapping loan time.


NOTES: WITHOUT OVERLAPS is tied to the primary key of Loans, which is the Interaction ID, not the Material ID. We need another solution.
