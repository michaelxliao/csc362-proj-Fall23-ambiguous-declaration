BR Descriptions:
    - Selection cascade delete: If any material from our selection is removed, we want to delete all records relating to that material. We have no more need for that information because we no longer have that piece of material. If there is a hold on a material, we will avoid deselecting it.
    - Patron cascade delete: Under most circumstances, we will implement a deny delete for inactive patrons. This way we can reactivate their account if needed. However, if asked, we will delete all records pertainig to a certain patron and then records in related tables that relate to that patron.
    - Space deny delete: If the library is ever renovated and a room is removed or changed, we want to keep data on that room. This allows us to keep track of which clubs and patrons have reserved these rooms. Furthermore, this allows us to keep track of how much each room is getting reserved.
