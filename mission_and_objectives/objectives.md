### Message From Therpston County Library
Salutations,

Thank you for your interest in supporting the Therpston County Public Library! We are pleased to accept your bid for redesigning the catalog system. We are looking forward to upgrading our systems to __enable deeper exploration__ of what the library has to offer.

We are particularly interested in promoting the connections between **print and multimedia**. Not only **audiobooks, film and TV adaptations of books and graphic novels** and comics, but also **novelizations of films**. These connections are often hard to make, because the related items do not always share the same names, and some stories may go by more than one name across different mediums! We feel that this is a powerful way to __revitalize the library__ and bring new members into our **book and film clubs.**

In addition to this exciting new initiative, we also need to **update our usual operating mechanisms related to loans and renewals, late fees, reservations, and our selection and deselection processes**.

users and operators

Sincerely,

Rita Booker Summit
Chief Librarian, Therpston Country Public Library
